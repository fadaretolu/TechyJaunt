      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare sector is receiving
        attention from researchers and health professionals. Few previous
        studies have investigated this topic from a multi- disciplinary
        perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision
        sciences and health professions AI has been involved in medicine since
        as early as the 1950s, when physicians made the first attempts to
        improve their diagnoses using computer-aided programs. Interest and
        advances in medical AI applications have surged in recent years due to
        the substantially enhanced computing power of modern computers and the
        vast amount of digital data available for collection and utilisation. AI
        is gradually changing medical practice.

        Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
        learning opportunities for all
        <br />
        Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of
        universal primary education. The total enrolment rate in developing
        regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children
        out of school has dropped by almost half.
        <br />
        There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more
        girls are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable
        successes. Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms
        the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven
        vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls
        and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030. It also
        aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, and to
        eliminate gender and wealth disparities with the aim of achieving
        universal access to a quality higher education.
        <br />
        Quality education is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda
        for Sustainable Development. An integrated approach is crucial for
        progress across the multiple goals.

      <p>
        Economic growth should be a positive force for the whole planet.This is
        why we must make sure that financial progress creates decent and
        fulfilling jobs while not harming the environment. We must protect
        labour rights and once and for all put a stop to modern slavery and
        child labour. If we promote job creation with expanded access to banking
        and financial services, we can make sure that everybody gets the
        benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation.
        <br />
        Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8 or Global Goal 8) is about "decent
        work and economic growth" and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development
        Goals which were established by the United Nations General Assembly in
        2015. The full title is to "Foster sustained, inclusive and sustainable
        economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.
        Progress towards targets will be measured, monitored and evaluated by 17
        indicators.
        <br />
        SDG 8 has twelve targets in total to be achieved by 2030. Some targets
        are for 2030; others are for 2020. The first ten are outcome targets.
        These are; "sustainable economic growth; diversify, innovate and upgrade
        for economic productivity", "promote policies to support job creation
        and growing enterprises", "improve resource efficiency in consumption
        and production", 'full employment and decent work with equal pay',
        'promote youth employment, education and training', 'end modern slavery,
        trafficking, and child labour', 'protect labour rights and promote safe
        working environments', 'promote beneficial and sustainable tourism',
        universal access to banking, insurance and financial services. In
        addition, there are also two targets for means of implementation, which
        are: Increase aid for trade support; develop a global youth employment
        strategy.

      <li><h2>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPEMENT GOAL 14</h2></li>
      <img src="/images/SDG14.jpg" alt="SDG14" />
      <p>
        Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Goal 14 or SDG 14) is about "Life below
        water" and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by
        the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is to "Conserve and
        sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable
        development". The Goal has ten targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress
        towards each target is being measured with one indicator each.
        <br />
        The first seven targets are outcome targets: Reduce marine pollution;
        protect and restore ecosystems; reduce ocean acidification; sustainable
        fishing; conserve coastal and marine areas; end subsidies contributing
        to overfishing; increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of
        marine resources. The last three targets are means of implementation
        targets: To increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for
        ocean health; support small scale fishers; implement and enforce
        international sea law. One indicator (14.1.1b) under Goal 14
        specifically relates to reducing impacts from marine plastic pollution.

        Nutrition: Processes of taking in and utilizing food substances. Food
        generates energy and supplies materials used in body tissues and
        processes. Calories are supplied by carbohydrates (sugars and starches),
        fats, and proteins. Other nutrients include minerals, vitamins, and
        dietary fibre. Minerals are used in many ways—iron for hemoglobin;
        calcium for bones, teeth, and cellular processes; sodium and potassium
        to regulate homeostasis, iodine to produce thyroid hormones. Trace
        minerals have functions that are less well-understood. Fibre is not
        broken down chemically in the body but aids digestion, lowers blood
        cholesterol, and may help prevent some cancers and hypertension.
        Different amounts of these nutrients exist in different foods; a varied
        diet ensures an adequate supply. Nutritional supplements, required by
        some people, do not compensate for an unhealthy diet. Sufficient water
        is always essential. Inadequate nutrient intake or absorption leads to
        malnutrition and disease.
